## Description

The Mail Service is a production-ready service that enables users to send emails with built-in failover capabilities
between various email service providers. It abstracts the interaction with email service providers, such as Amazon SES,
ensuring that in case of a provider failure, the service quickly switches to an alternative provider without affecting
the user experience.

This service is well-suited for applications heavily reliant on email notifications, aiming to guarantee the highest
level of reliability and availability.

## Solution

The Mail Service is a backend service offering a RESTful API for sending emails. It focuses on providing a seamless
experience for users without the need for a full-stack application.


## Back-End

The Mail Service's backend is implemented in Java using the Spring framework. Spring is a well-established and highly
reliable technology for building robust web applications, making it a suitable choice for the backend.

The decision to use Spring offers several advantages:

**Security:** Spring provides robust security features to safeguard sensitive email data and user information.<br>
**Scalability:** Spring's modular architecture simplifies scaling the service as the user base grows.<br>
**Reliability:** SExtensive testing and strong community support for Spring ensure a reliable and stable
application.<br>

## Technical Choices

The back-end is built with Java and Spring due to the following reasons:

**Experience:** The team has extensive experience with Java and Spring, making it a logical choice to ensure the
robustness of the service.
**Community Support:** Spring has a large and active community, which means access to a wealth of knowledge, libraries,
and support.
**Security:** Security is paramount in handling email data, and Spring's security features are well-suited for this
purpose.

## Trade-Offs

While we have chosen to build a full-stack application, we acknowledge that there are trade-offs involved. Building both
the front-end and back-end can increase development time, but it allows for greater control and customization. If we
were to spend additional time on the project, we might consider the following improvements:

Integration of More Email Providers: Currently, we support Amazon SES as an email provider. Expanding to support other
providers can enhance the failover capabilities further.
Advanced User Management: Implementing user accounts, authentication, and authorization for tracking email history and
managing email templates.
